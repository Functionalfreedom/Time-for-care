# Failure Mode Taxonomy

| Failure         | Behavior               |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| UI change       | System disables itself |
| Context ambiguity | System stays silent |
| Performance lag | System exits           |
| Internal error  | System clears state    |

The safest system is one that knows when to disappear.
