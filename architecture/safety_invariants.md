# Safety Invariants

These rules must always hold:

1. The system must never interfere with patient care.
2. The system must never generate medical advice.
3. The system must never hide or alter clinician intent.
4. The system must fail silently under uncertainty.
5. The clinician is always in control.

Any violation invalidates the design.
