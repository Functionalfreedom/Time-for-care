# The Problem: Time Lost to Documentation

Canada’s healthcare system is under strain. Emergency departments are crowded, inpatient wards are full, and clinicians are exhausted. While staffing shortages and funding constraints are real, a less visible bottleneck quietly limits care every day: documentation.

Physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals spend a significant portion of their working hours charting, copying information between screens, and satisfying compliance requirements. Much of this work is necessary, but much of it is repetitive, fragmented, and poorly aligned with how humans actually think and work.

The result is not just frustration. It directly reduces:
- Time spent with patients
- Speed of admissions and discharges
- Safe throughput of hospital beds
- Clinician morale and retention

This project starts from a simple premise:

> If clinicians could complete required documentation faster and with less cognitive friction — without cutting corners — Canada’s healthcare system could care for more people with the same resources.

This repository documents our attempt to explore that premise seriously, conservatively, and transparently.
