# Hospital Bottlenecks We Studied

Through analysis of public research, clinician testimony, and workflow studies in Canadian hospitals, several consistent bottlenecks emerge.

## 1. Fragmented Time
Clinicians rarely have long, uninterrupted periods to think or write. Documentation is constantly interrupted by pages, consults, and urgent patient needs.

## 2. Documentation Debt
Notes are often delayed until the end of a shift, creating "+catch-up" work that extends hours and increases error risk.

## 3. Compliance Bloat
Many documentation fields exist due to institutional habit rather than legal necessity. Clinicians often document defensively rather than clinically.

## 4. Discharge Delays
Even when a patient is medically ready to leave, paperwork delays can keep beds occupied for hours.

These bottlenecks are not caused by a lack of skill or effort — they are structural. This project treats them as an optimization problem, not a human failure.
