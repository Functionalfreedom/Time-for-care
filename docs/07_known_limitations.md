# Known Limitations

This document outlines the known limitations of the "Time for Care" project. We encourage users and contributors to take these into account when working with the project.

1. **Scalability Issues**:
   - The current system architecture may struggle under extremely high traffic conditions. Optimization and more thorough testing is needed to ensure scalability.

2. **Cross-browser Compatibility**:
   - Full compatibility with older browsers has not been rigorously tested. Users may encounter rendering issues in browsers like Internet Explorer.

3. **Limited Localization Support**:
   - The software currently supports only English. Adding multilingual features is planned for future updates.

4. **Incomplete Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - While most pages are responsive, some UI elements do not function optimally on smaller devices.

5. **API Rate Limit Issues**:
   - There can be rate-limiting issues when using third-party APIs during extended usage sessions.

6. **Edge Cases in User Inputs**:
   - Some edge cases regarding unusual user inputs have not been covered yet.

These limitations provide valuable input areas for improvement and development.
