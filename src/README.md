🙅 **What This Is Not**

This is NOT production-ready code.
- Iteration and debugging are expected.
- No integration exists yet for hospital environments.
- This remains hypothetical without full validation in secure settings.

🧭 **Guiding Principles**

This project holds itself accountable to the following:
- Cognitive-first design principles: Always protect uninterrupted focus.
- Safety and silence defaults: If uncertain, do nothing.
- Ethical delivery: Never replace trust-driven care by caregivers.
